              <p className="text-lg">
                PATHFIT Cocina is a fun and interactive activity under the PATHFIT (Physical Activity Towards Health and
                Fitness) program that focuses on nutrition and healthy eating. It combines practical cooking knowledge
                with scientific nutrition concepts to help students understand the value of balanced meals. Using the
                Pinggang Pinoy model as a guide, PATHFIT Cocina teaches how to prepare nutritious dishes that support
                energy, focus, and overall wellness in everyday life.
              </p>
              <p>
                The day began with each group preparing and plating their nutritious dishes, guided by the principles of
                the Pinggang Pinoy model. Once the meals were ready, a panel of judges evaluated the dishes based on
                presentation, balance, and nutritional value.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the highlights of the event was the food tasting, where everyone had the chance to sample each
                group's creations. This not only made the experience enjoyable but also allowed students to appreciate
                the variety and creativity in preparing healthy meals.

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">My Experience</h2>
              <p>
                Participating in PATHFIT Cocina 2024 was a memorable highlight of my PATHFIT 2 journey. The activity
                gave me a deeper understanding of how nutrition supports an active and healthy lifestyle. It was
                exciting to apply what we learned in class by actually preparing and presenting balanced meals guided by
                the Pinggang Pinoy model.
              </p>
              <p>
                I especially enjoyed collaborating with my group during the cooking and plating process. It allowed us
                to be creative while also staying mindful of nutritional value. Seeing the variety of dishes prepared by
                other groups showed me how healthy food can also be fun, diverse, and culturally meaningful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of all, PATHFIT Cocina reminded me that taking care of our bodies starts with what we put on our
                plates. It was an eye-opening and rewarding experience that inspired me to make better food choices and
                to share what I've learned with others. It wasn't just a cooking activity ‚Äî it was a step toward a
                healthier lifestyle.
